  <h1>10 Signs You Should NOT Buy That TV (Before You Regret It!)</h1>

  <p>Buying a new TV is exciting – but it's also one of the most mistake-prone purchases. Here are 10 red flags that smart shoppers should avoid. Whether you're buying in Kenya or anywhere else, these tips will help you pick a TV that's actually worth your money.</p>

  <h2>1. Unrealistic "Store Mode" Picture</h2>  
  <p>Many TVs in store use a "demo" or "store mode" that boosts brightness, contrast, and color to look impressive. But once switched to normal (home) mode, the picture quality often drops drastically. Always ask the shop to change the mode – if it looks weak, that's a big warning sign.</p>

  <h2>2. The TV Size Doesn't Match Your Room</h2>  
  <p>Choosing the wrong size can ruin your viewing experience. Sit too close, and the picture feels overwhelming or pixelated; sit too far, and you lose immersion.</p>

  <div>  
    <strong>Recommended Viewing Distance by Size:</strong><br>  
    Based on standard guidelines: 55″ → ~2.0–2.7 m, 65″ → ~2.3–3.2 m, 75″ → ~2.8–3.8 m.
  </div>

  <p>These numbers align with expert advice: for example, LG recommends sitting about 1.2× your TV's diagonal length away.</p>

  <h2>3. Too Few HDMI Ports</h2>  
  <p>If the TV only has two HDMI ports but you plan to connect a streaming box, a game console, a soundbar, and maybe something else – you're going to run out fast. More HDMI inputs = more flexibility.</p>

  <h2>4. No HDMI 2.1 (Especially If You Game)</h2>  
  <p>For gamers using newer consoles (like PS5 or Xbox Series), HDMI 2.1 is crucial. It enables features like 4K at 120 Hz, variable refresh rate (VRR), and more. Without it, you'll lose out on smooth, high-frame-rate gaming.</p>

  <h2>5. Weak or Tiny Built-in Sound</h2>  
  <p>Many modern TVs come with slim profiles that compromise speaker quality. If the TV's built-in speakers are weak, you should budget for a soundbar.</p>

  <h2>6. Over-the-Top Marketing Terms</h2>  
  <p>Be careful of buzzwords like "Quantum Motion X-Pro," "Ultra Hyper Dimming," or "Mega 9000 Refresh Rate." These are often marketing fluff. Focus instead on real specs: panel type, brightness (nits), refresh rate, HDR certification, etc.</p>

  <h2>7. Dirty Screen Effect (DSE)</h2>  
  <p>The <em>Dirty Screen Effect</em> is a uniformity issue where parts of the screen look blotchy, shadowed, or banded, especially on gray or flat-color backgrounds. </p>  
  <p>You can test for it in-store by having the seller show you a gray or white slide. If you see uneven patches or vertical/horizontal banding, that's DSE. </p>

  <h2>8. Poor Build Quality / Shaky Stand</h2>  
  <p>If the TV wobbles when tapped, or if the stand feels cheap and fragile, that's a sign the manufacturer cut corners. A stable stand is essential for safety and durability.</p>

  <h2>9. Slow Smart TV Interface</h2>  
  <p>Smart TV OS that lags when opening apps is a real pain. Test the interface in-store: open YouTube, Netflix, or the home menu. If it's slow, you'll regret it later.</p>

  <h2>10. Suspiciously Low Price or Shady Seller</h2>  
  <p>If a TV deal seems <em>too good to be true</em>, check warranty details, seller credibility, and return policies. Cheap brands or unclear return terms are often a trap.</p>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>  
  <p>A TV is a long-term investment. By avoiding these 10 red flags, you're more likely to get a reliable, high-quality set that fits your space, your content habits, and your budget. Test in-store, check specs, and make sure what you're really buying matches what you <em>actually want</em>.</p>

  <p>Happy TV shopping – and may your next set bring only joy, no regrets.</p>
